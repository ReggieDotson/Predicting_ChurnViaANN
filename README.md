# Predicting_ChurnViaANN

The data used in this project is a learning training set for a bank with 10000 customers who were randomly selected from a much larger dataset. These customers were followed for 6 months to study which customers churned/left the bank or remained with the bank after 6 months. Our binary response variable in this dataset is labeled "Exited." The number 1 indicates the customer left and 0 indicates the customer stayed with the bank.

We want to find the probability that the customer leaves the bank.

Three columns in this data set will be excluded as it's determined to not have any relavence to our objective. Those columns to be removed are:

RowNumber Customerid Surname
